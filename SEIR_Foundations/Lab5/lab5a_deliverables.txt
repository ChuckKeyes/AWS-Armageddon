A short “Analyst Notes” page (10–15 lines) answering:
    Which findings are likely duplicates?
    Which 5 findings would you investigate first and why?

Bonus (Honors)

    Chunking large reports into batches with a stable merging strategy
    Source-specific parsers for ZAP/Trivy/Checkov instead of generic extraction
    Add a “Evidence Map” section: each finding links back to file + line path
